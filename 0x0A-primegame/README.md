# 0x0A. Prime Game
- Algorithm
- Python

# Concepts Needed:
Prime Numbers:

1. Understanding what prime numbers are.
Efficient algorithms for identifying prime numbers within a range.

2. Sieve of Eratosthenes:
An efficient algorithm for finding all prime numbers up to any given limit, which can be particularly useful for this task.

3. Game Theory:
Basic principles of competitive games where players take turns and the concept of optimal play.
Understanding win conditions and strategies that lead to a win or loss.

4. Dynamic Programming/Memoization:
Using previous results to make future calculations faster, potentially necessary for optimizing the solution for multiple rounds of the game.

5. Python Programming:
Loops and conditional statements for implementing game logic and algorithms.
Arrays and lists for storing the integers and tracking removed numbers.
